            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi! I'm Chelsa, a third-year Data Science and Economics student at Northeastern University. Outside academics and building intricate Sims 4 houses, I focus on my plant mom journey. I believe it was in June of this year when I bought my first plant. I didn't plan on becoming so invested in them, but after propagating a basil, I found that growing something was very rewarding. So far, I have a corn plant, parlor palm, money tree, polka dot plant, snake plant, and a pot of succulents. I also  have basils, green onions, kale seedlings (joint-custody with my roommate), and I very recently started trying to grow red and green bell peppers and jalapeño. </p>

            <p> My affinity for plants did not just come from my impulsive decision-making habit. My grandmother *loves* plants. My childhood home was more of a garden with a house than the other way around. This was in a tropical country, so the weather was great for growing plants. Someday I want to be able to grow some of my favorite plants that my Nana has. Unfortunately, I like living in New England so it’s going to be a huge challenge. But that’s a problem for next time. I’ll grow the kales and the peppers, then figure out my next steps. For now it’s all about taking care of my current plant children and reading them spooky stories at night. <p>
